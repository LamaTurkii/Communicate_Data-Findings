# by: lama alruhaimi

# Dataset
I analyzed Ford GoBike datasets. I have used Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns, and relationships
In the dataset there are 183,413 data trips for FordGoBike in the dataset.

The dataset includes:
- duration_sec,
- start_time,
- end_time,
- start_station_id,
- start_station_name,
- start_station_latitude,
- start_station_longitude,
- end_station_id,
- end_station_name,
- end_station_latitude,
- end_station_longitude,
- bike_id,
- user_type,
- member_birth_year,
- member_gender,
- bike_share_for_all_trip.

# Summary of Findings
- in the exploration, I found that there are two types of user:
Subscriber and Customer.
- there is more than 120000 Male and 40000 Female, and few number of others
- the subscriber higher than customer

# Key Insights for Presentation
For my presentation, I will focus on the difference in usage for customers and subscribers. I will start with the univariate results, I will show the average trip duration in seconds and the average trip duration in minutes, then I will compare between subscriber and customers and count of male and female and others.
